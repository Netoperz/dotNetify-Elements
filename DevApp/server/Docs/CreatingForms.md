## Creating Forms

Creating forms from scratch with React can be quite a chore. If you are a line-of-business application developer, you know that there are plenty of aspects that you need to get right, from providing different types of inputs with the right layout, doing different kinds of validations (some asynchronously) and having their error messages shown, to tracking dirty state to get the submit button enabled, and making sure all the required inputs are filled before user can submit. 

_Form Elements_ can help you avoid repetition and getting all of these done with just a little bit of work, and as you continue along this tutorial, you will see reactive programming can help reduce the complexity on the back-end, and significantly so on handling nested forms.
